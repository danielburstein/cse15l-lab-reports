2. There wasn't an output but there was a change in the directory I was in. Before the command, I was in the directory /home, and after the command, I was in the directory /home/lecture1 . This change happened because the cd command changed the directory I was in based on my input (lecture1) 
3. This output is not an error.

**LS Command:**
---
- Input: None
  
![Image](ls no input.png)

1. Working Directory: /home
2. The output I got was that it printed out "lecture1". I got this output because ls is used to print out all files and directories inside your current directory or the input directory. I didn't give an input in this case so it printed everything in /home (my Working Directory)
3. This output is not an error.
